# colors
A social media web app that moves beyond the negative impacts of having likes and dislikes on posts. 
We introduce Colored reactions, featuring a color board summary of the reactions on each post - this creates a way for users to interact with each other in a genuine, expressive way, while leaving out the fear of having a lack of likes that most social medias bring.
